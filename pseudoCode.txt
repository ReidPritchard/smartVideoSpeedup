Steps:
    a) take video filename from input (look into piping)
  1) Split audio from video
    a) Use system("ffmpeg -i "+ videoInput.avi + " -vn tempSound.au?") - [.au as it is better for the libsndfile library]
    b) load in tempSound.wav back into the program (using some library TBD)
  2) Break audio into chunks
    
    a) Find min & Max Volume and use as threshold
  3) Check if chunk is silent (or close to min threshold value)
  4) If silent, save timestamp in list
  5) Once all chunks are checked, either re-assemble or reload file and edit based on timestamp list
